Ever wondered how the news channels predict weather conditions accurately? Itâ€™s because they leverage data science, which is always working in the background in the process of weather prediction.

## Short description

### What's the problem?

Agriculture or farming is the practice of cultivating plants and livestock. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities.Modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields, but cause ecological and environmental damage.In agriculture, many times farmers have to spread fertilisers on plants. So before spreading they had to predict weather condition. Is is suitable or not? What will happen in next 1/2 weeks? What is the exact suitable timeperiod? Afer spreding fertilizers they faced lot of challenges like heavy rains washed it all,too much hot weather burns the plant. Due to this at the end, they suffer losses.

### How can technology help?
To help the farmers, they need to predict the weather condition. They need one specific app or tool where they can easily know the weather conditions. And here Data science, Machine learning, Artificial intelligence plays the important role to predict future trend from its historical datas.

### The idea

The idea is like, get the historical weather data and from that data predict the future trend. Analyze it and make it better visualization. 
Rightnow for fertilization, farmers  get the specific timeperiod where it is good to spreadout or wait for somedays or too much risky. They will get the indications that when they can use the ferlizers. 

Future trends- We can see a specific app for farmers where which crops we can grow for that specific time period using weather condition.
