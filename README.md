Ever wondered how the news channels predict weather conditions accurately? It’s because they leverage data science, which is always working in the background in the process of weather prediction.

## Short description

### What's the problem?

Agriculture or farming is the practice of cultivating plants and livestock. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities.Modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields, but cause ecological and environmental damage.In agriculture, many times farmers have to spread fertilisers on plants. So before spreading they had to predict weather condition. Is is suitable or not? What will happen in next 1/2 weeks? What is the exact suitable timeperiod? Afer spreding fertilizers they faced lot of challenges like heavy rains washed it all,too much hot weather burns the plant. Due to this at the end, they suffer losses.

### How can technology help?
To help the farmers, they need to predict the weather condition. They need one specific app or tool where they can easily know the weather conditions. And here Data science, Machine learning, Artificial intelligence plays the important role to predict future trend from its historical datas.

### The idea

The idea is like, get the historical weather data and from that data predict the future trend. Analyze it and make it better visualization. 
Rightnow for fertilization, farmers  get the specific timeperiod where it is good to spreadout or wait for somedays or too much risky. They will get the indications that when they can use the ferlizers. 

Future trends- We can see a specific app for farmers where which crops we can grow for that specific time period using weather condition.

# Submission name- Weather data Analysis and Visualization 

Agriculture or farming is the practice of cultivating plants and livestock. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities.Agriculture is one of the sectors most dependent on weather conditions, being its output strongly aﬀectedby them. The eﬀect of abnormal weather conditions on fertilizer application is far from easily predictable. Our focus encompasses both the immediate response to dryness and wetness conditions and, particularly, the lagged response. In fact, from a policy perspective, it is important to understand which are the lasting consequences of these weather phenomena.If a drought or an excess of rain is happening or is foreseen to happen at the time of fertilizer application,the immediate response of a farmer could be to increase the amount of fertilizer to counterbalance the likely output loss caused by the adverse weather conditions or she could opt to reduce it to avoid wasting input expenditures.
The lagged response, as to say the application of fertilizer in a time period subsequent the happening of a weather shock, seems to be more easily predictable. Since a signiﬁcant departure from expected levels of wetness is associated with a reduction in productivity, this implies a lower nutrients up take by plants. This further causes a lower need of fertilization in the subsequent year1. However, although heavy rains may damage cropsas much as drought, they could also cause a run–oﬀ of fertilizer from the soil, thus nullifying this argument.

The project description is organized as follows. Section 1 provides a brief Introduction and describes the data used. In Section 2 we explain the web-scrapping, Pre-processing method, data cleaning. In Section 3 we provide the visualizations and discuss the results. Finally, Section 4 concludes/results


## Section 1- Brief Introduction and describes the data

In this Section we brieﬂy introduce a description of the data used in our analysis. The dependent variable which affects the fertilizer has been taken out. In data"s parameters like temperature, cloud cover, sunshine, global radiation, snow depth, precipitation are being used. 


### Subsection 1.1- Context

The dataset featured below was created by reconciling measurements from requests of individual weather attributes provided by the European Climate Assessment (ECA).

### Subsection 1.2- Content

The list of attributes and their description summaries:

date - recorded date of measurement - (int)
cloud_cover - cloud cover measurement in oktas - (float)
sunshine - sunshine measurement in hours (hrs) - (float)
global_radiation - irradiance measurement in Watt per square meter (W/m2) - (float)
max_temp - maximum temperature recorded in degrees Celsius (°C) - (float)
mean_temp - mean temperature in degrees Celsius (°C) - (float)
min_temp - minimum temperature recorded in degrees Celsius (°C) - (float)
precipitation - precipitation measurement in millimeters (mm) - (float)
pressure - pressure measurement in Pascals (Pa) - (float)
snow_depth - snow depth measurement in centimeters (cm) - (float)
